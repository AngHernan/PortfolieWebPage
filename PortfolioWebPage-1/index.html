    <!--About me-->
    <section>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>During my time at UCI I constantly struggled to answer the question about what career I'd like to find after college. I thought of being an accountant, marketing agent, and police officer but none of these options felt right. After college I stilled struggled with the question and even felt that I wasted my time. Although I always studied some form of coding during school, usually in the form of python, I struggled a lot with it and didn't understand it. A year after graduation I started to look into python some more with the help of some freinds from college who graduated as Computer Science majors. I realized that I had a lot of fun writing small programs and I began to look at some of the resources from courses I took at UCI to delve deeper into the python language. I started to build programs that I thought were impossible tasks for me. I realized then that I could make this a career. I made it my goal to join a bootcamp to learn more so that I can find a career in the field of software engineering.</p> 
        
        <p>I definitely have a pasion for learning and I've enjoyed my journey thus far. If you are looking for a junior developer, feel free to contact me.</p>
